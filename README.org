* Introduction
Robo-Tweeter is a python application for tweeting results of matches at robotics competitions. It uses the FRCFMS twitter account to get the results of matches and tweet the results.

* Requirements
You need python 2.7 or thereabouts and an internet connection to run Robo-tweeter.
: Note: Most first robotics competitions don't have a reliable internet connection
:       so, it makes sense to run this on a server or computer that will not be at
:       the competition unless you KNOW that you'll have an internet connection.

* Setup and installation
1. =git clone me=
2. CD into the directory
3. =git clone tweepy= if you don't already have tweepy installed
4. Run =./main.py= and follow the prompts (if you have issues, try =python main.py=)
